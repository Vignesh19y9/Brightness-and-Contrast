# Brightness-and-Contrast


This repository is a straightforward Python implementation of Brightness and Contrast on an image. The 2 operations are done on the same image by calculating a gamma value. 
Change the respected value from 0 to 127 for increaseing the intensity and from 0 to -127 for decreaseing the intesty. 

# Normal image :

brightness = 0
contrast = 0

# High brightness and contrast : 

brightness = 127
contrast = 127
